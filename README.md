## Overview of the school district analysis: 
---
The analysis of the school district is to show each school size, school type, and spending per student to determine any correlation 
students math, reading, and overall sources.  After the initial analysis was complete a problem was discovered with the 
Thomas High School 9th graders.  The problem with the 9th graders required that their reading and math scores were removed from 
the percentage of passing scores for math and reading but only for Thomas High School.  The remaining schools did not have any grade altered.

percentage passing was slightly lower for the district.  The Thomas High School 9th graders removed from the data total 461 students, so
